# Description of attributes:  



1. **Fixed acidity**: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)  

2. **Volatile acidity**: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste  

3. **Citric acid**: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines  

4. **Residual sugar**: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet  

5. **Chlorides**: the amount of salt in the wine  

6. **Free sulfur dioxide**: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine  

7. **Total sulfur dioxide**: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine  

8. **Density**: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content 

9. **pH**: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale  

10. **Sulphates**: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant  

11. **Alcohol**: the percent alcohol content of the wine  

12. **Quality**: output variable (based on sensory data, score between 0 and 10)
